# *STM32_Project*
***

#####*Projects*
This folder contain everything to build firmware.
To buld firmaware just make new workspace in *System Workbench (sw4stm32)*
and place all this files into it.

If You want to upload already builded firmware, You need to look in *Release_bins* folder for "*X.bin*" files.
To upload this files You may to use *STM32 Flash loader demonstrator*.
##### * Release_bins*:
  * For *sGPU Pro* upload stm32_sGPU_Pro.bin;
  * For *sGPU mini* upload stm32_sGPU_BluePill.bin.

##### All used GPIO for *sGPU* on STM32 can be found in:
  * STM32_GPU_GPIO_Pinout.txt
  * STM32F103C8T6_pinout.png
  * STM32F407VET6_pinout.png

#####*RAMmath.txt*
In this file showed few calulations for what things *RAM* was utilized.
